Voucher Generation Web Application

This project is a smart, automated voucher generation system that creates formatted payment vouchers by using uploaded Excel data, signatures, and organization details. It helps reduce manual work and ensures consistent formatting across all vouchers.

Project Overview

Automatically generates vouchers from uploaded Excel files.

Users can upload organizational logo and signatures once, and the system automatically applies them based on branch logic.

Bank details, payment method, and amount are filled automatically from the Excel data.

Designed to provide clean formatting, improved workflow, and reduced human error.

Features

Single upload for multiple receiver signatures.

Branch-based signature mapping using business logic.

Auto-fill of Bank details, Amount, Payment Method, and Receiver fields.

Default logo and signature are used if not provided.

Clean, professional voucher format ready for printing or export.

Simple UI and easy-to-use workflow.

Avoids repetitive user input and improves efficiency.

Technical Highlights

Data automation workflow using rule-based logic.

Multi-image upload support for signatures in a single action.

Dynamic placement of signatures in voucher template.

Automatic identification of branch via "Being" or category logic.

Runs smoothly inside Google AI Studio–assisted environment.

Emphasis on reusable, scalable voucher templates.
